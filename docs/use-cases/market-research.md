## Problem it solves

Traditional market research requires:

- Repetitive searching across sites and databases.
- Manual copy‑paste into documents or slides.
- Constant context switching between tools.

This slows teams down and makes it hard to keep insights up to date.

Ravian acts as an autonomous researcher that can repeat and refresh this process on demand.

## Example workflow: New market entry brief

1. Define the goal, for example:

    ```text title="prompt"
    Research the Indian SME lending market and create a 5-page brief with key players, product types, regulations, and top risks.
    ```

2. Ravian plans steps to scan relevant sources, extract structured notes, and organize them into sections.

3. It generates a brief with headings like Market Overview, Customer Segments, Competitors, and Regulatory Context.

4. You review the brief, then ask Ravian to convert it into a 12‑slide deck for an executive meeting.

This pattern works for new product exploration, regional expansion, vendor scouting, and competitor tracking.
