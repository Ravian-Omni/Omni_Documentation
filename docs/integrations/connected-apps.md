## What Ravian can do with integrations

Once connected, Ravian can coordinate actions across multiple apps within a single workflow.

A single task can, for example, collect research from the web, draft a report in Google Docs, store artifacts in Google Drive, log decisions in Notion, schedule follow-up meetings in Google Calendar, and open GitHub issues based on findings.

All actions remain visible, traceable, and controllable throughout execution.

## Using integrations safely

Ravian enforces strict control boundaries when working with connected services.

Human approval is required for sending messages, modifying shared content, or performing sensitive actions.  
Access can be limited to specific accounts, folders, or repositories.  
All integration activity is recorded in the execution history.

Only connect the services required for your workflows.

## Adding more integrations

Ravian’s integration framework is designed to scale.

New integrations can be added without changing your existing workflows. Each integration will appear in this section with supported actions and any required setup steps.
