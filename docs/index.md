# Ravian AI

Ravian AI is a **device-native autonomous AI agent** powered by Large Action Models (LAMs). It thinks, plans, and executes directly on your machine, transforming high-level goals into real actions across applications, files, and the web.

Instead of switching between tools, tabs, and workflows, you describe the outcome once. Ravian designs the workflow, executes each step autonomously, validates results, and delivers the final output.

## Introduction

The following video provides a quick visual introduction to Ravian AI and how it operates as an autonomous action-driven agent.

## Modes of operation

Ravian supports two complementary interaction modes depending on the depth of the workflow.

### Chat Mode

Chat Mode provides a conversational interface combined with real execution.

It is suitable for tasks such as:

- Drafting and sending emails with review and approval.
- Browsing the web and generating structured summaries.
- Rewriting, analyzing, or synthesizing documents.
- Performing focused automation tasks with immediate feedback.

Chat Mode is optimized for rapid, interactive automation where control and speed are equally important.

### Task Mode

Task Mode is designed for **long-running, multi-step workflows** that require planning, validation, and orchestration across tools.

Typical use cases include:

- Research combined with data analysis and presentation generation.
- Web application development or automation pipeline construction.
- Repetitive enterprise workflows that demand consistency and auditability.

In Task Mode, Ravian creates an explicit execution plan, presents it for review, and then executes the workflow autonomously with built-in quality checks and human-in-the-loop control.

## What Ravian AI is

Ravian operates as a persistent digital teammate rather than a passive assistant. It observes instructions, decomposes them into ordered actions, selects the appropriate tools, and executes tasks using system-level control.

At its core, Ravian uses Large Action Models to interact with user interfaces, APIs, and files. This allows it to navigate, type, click, execute code, and adapt dynamically to changing environments while maintaining consistency and reliability.

## What Ravian AI can do

Ravian is built to complete entire workflows end-to-end, including:

- **Autonomous research** for academic, corporate, and market intelligence, producing structured briefs and presentations.
- **Data science workflows** covering dataset discovery, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and report generation.
- **Presentation and document creation** tailored to specific audiences and objectives.
- **Web application development** including project scaffolding, coding, dependency handling, and execution.
- **Productivity automation** such as email handling, calendar scheduling, job application flows, and operational reporting.
- **Browser and UI automation** for form filling, navigation, and cross-tool orchestration.
- **Multimodal processing** across text, images, audio, and video within unified workflows.

## Why Ravian AI is different

Most AI systems stop at recommendations. Ravian is built for execution.

Key design principles include:

- **Large Action Model foundation** that enables reasoning over action sequences rather than isolated text responses.
- **Device-native execution** for privacy, low latency, and direct control over local systems.
- **End-to-end autonomy** with dynamic subtask creation and orchestration.
- **Built-in validation and recovery** to detect failures and correct them automatically.
- **Human-in-the-loop governance** for sensitive or high-impact operations.

## When to use Ravian AI

Ravian is most valuable when tasks involve multiple steps, tools, or decisions.

Examples include:

- Generating a complete market or competitor report with sources and presentation output.
- Performing full data analysis and producing executive-ready visuals.
- Managing large volumes of communication or operational workflows.
- Automating complex processes that normally require constant manual supervision.
