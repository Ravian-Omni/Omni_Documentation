## What this capability does

Ravian's data workflows can:

- Locate and ingest datasets from local files, cloud storage, or public sources.
- Clean and preprocess data, handle missing values, encode categories, and engineer features.
- Run exploratory data analysis (EDA) with descriptive statistics and visual summaries.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models where appropriate.
- Generate visual outputs including charts, dashboards, and annotated plots.

!!! note
    Task Mode saves full notebooks, datasets, and models to your workspace for reproducibility.

## Typical workflows

Examples of data workflows:

- Full EDA on customer, sales, or operational datasets.
- Churn prediction, customer segmentation, or forecasting models.
- Executive dashboards from raw operational data.
- A/B test analysis with statistical significance testing.

## Example: Customer churn analysis

1. Start the task:

    ```text title="Prompt"
    Analyze customer_churn.csv: identify at-risk segments, build a prediction model, and create an 8-slide executive summary.
    ```

2. Ravian loads data, runs EDA, engineers features, trains models, and generates visualizations.

3. It creates a presentation with key findings, model performance, and actionable recommendations.

4. All notebooks, models, and raw outputs are saved to your workspace for team review.

End-to-end data science without manual scripting.
