## What this capability does

Task Mode integrations enable:

- Read/write across Google Drive, Notion, GitHub, email, and calendars.
- Context passing between apps (research → Notion → Slack → email).
- Scheduled recurring workflows across multiple systems.
- Audit trails and approval gates for enterprise compliance.
- Custom API integrations for proprietary systems.

!!! note
    All connected apps require explicit user approval during setup.

## Typical workflows

Cross-system automation:

- Weekly reporting: data → Google Sheets → Slides → team email.
- Project onboarding: GitHub issue → Notion page → Slack channel → calendar invite.
- Customer success: CRM update → personalized email → follow-up task.

## Example: Weekly reporting pipeline

1. Define the workflow:

    ```text title="Prompt"
    Every Monday: pull support metrics, create Google Slides, save to Drive, email link to ops team.
    ```

2. Ravian executes across all systems: data extraction → analysis → slide generation → Drive upload → email dispatch.

3. Human approval required before email send; full logs saved.

4. Workflow runs autonomously on schedule.

Your apps, fully connected and automated.
