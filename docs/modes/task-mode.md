# Task Mode

Task Mode is where Ravian becomes a **full workflow engine**. You give it a complex goal; it creates an explicit plan, executes step by step, validates results, and keeps running until the outcome is delivered or a decision is needed.

Use Task Mode for deep, multi‑step work that would otherwise take hours of manual effort.

## When to use Task Mode

Task Mode is best for:

- Long‑running workflows with many steps or branches.
- Processes that touch multiple apps, files, and data sources.
- High‑stakes or repeatable tasks where you want clear plans, logs, and approvals.

Typical examples:

- “Do a full market landscape study and deliver a report plus a 15‑slide deck.”
- “Build and evaluate a churn prediction model from my customer dataset.”
- “Clone this website’s structure and content into my own project.”
- “Every Monday, pull last week’s metrics, create a PDF report, and email it to the team.”

## How Task Mode works

Each Task Mode run goes through a structured loop:

1. **Understand the goal** – Ravian interprets your instruction and constraints.
2. **Plan the workflow** – it produces a visible multi‑step plan: research, data processing, writing, automation steps, and outputs.
3. **Ask for approval** – you review and approve or edit the plan before anything runs.
4. **Execute with validation** – Ravian performs each step, checks intermediate results, and retries or adjusts when something fails.
5. **Request human decisions** – for sensitive actions (emails, form submissions, system changes), it pauses and asks for your approval.
6. **Deliver final artifacts** – documents, decks, code, logs, or automation results are saved to your chosen locations.

You always have a clear view of progress and a trace of what happened.

## What you can build in Task Mode

Task Mode can orchestrate all of Ravian’s core capabilities in a single workflow:

- **Autonomous research** that feeds into reports and presentations.
- **Data analysis & visualization** chained into model training and evaluation.
- **Presentation generation** automatically updated when data or research changes.
- **Web automation & browsing** across many sites, including retries and error handling.
- **App & workflow integration** with email, calendar, storage, and developer tools.
- **Multimodal processing** that turns raw audio/video into transcripts, insights, and finished assets.

Because the plan is explicit, you can reuse and adapt successful tasks as templates.

## Chat Mode vs Task Mode

A simple rule of thumb:

- Use **Chat Mode** when the task fits in a short conversation and you want fast, interactive results.
- Use **Task Mode** when the task is **complex, recurring, or mission‑critical**, and you want Ravian to manage the full lifecycle with planning, validation, and approvals.

You can start in Chat Mode, then promote a successful flow to Task Mode when you are ready to scale it or run it on a schedule.
