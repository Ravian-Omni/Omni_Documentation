## Best practices for Facebook

- **Video > Images.** Native video gets 2–3x reach.  
- **Post 3–5x/week.** Consistent value over frequency.  
- **Engage fast.** Reply to comments within 2h for algorithm boost.  
- **Combine platforms.** Flow: YouTube → Facebook video → Instagram Reel → Twitter thread.

To connect Facebook, open **Settings → Connections → Facebook** (Page/Group admin required). Then run prompts directly from Chat Mode.
