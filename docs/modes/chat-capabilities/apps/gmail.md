## What Ravian can do with Gmail

In Chat Mode, Gmail integration enables:

- Drafting personalized emails based on chat context or attached documents.
- Sending emails after a one‑click approval step.
- Generating follow‑up emails from previous threads.
- Creating small outbound campaigns (for example, 5–10 contacts) with tailored messages.

!!! warning
    Ravian always asks for approval before sending or deleting emails. You stay in control.

    Looks good. Send this from my Gmail to everyone on the calendar event.
    

### 2. Clear your inbox

    
    Scan my unread emails from today. Summarize them in bullets and propose replies for anything that needs more than a yes/no.
    Approve or edit individual replies inline before sending.
    

### 3. Small outreach batch

    
    Using this CSV of contacts, draft 5 personalized outreach emails about our new Ravian AI beta. Keep each email under 120 words and friendly in tone.

## Best practices

Start with draft‑only workflows until you're comfortable, then allow Ravian to send after explicit approval.

- Be specific about tone (“formal”, “casual”, “to a close colleague”).

- Use attached documents or transcripts so Ravian has enough context to write accurate emails.

- To connect Gmail, go to Settings → Connections → Gmail in the Ravian app and follow the sign‑in flow.
