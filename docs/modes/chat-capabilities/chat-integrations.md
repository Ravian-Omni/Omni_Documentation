# Chat Integrations

To unlock **fully automated chat workflows**, connect Ravian to a few key apps. In Chat Mode, these integrations let Ravian read, write, and coordinate work directly from the conversation.

To manage connections, open **Settings → Connections** inside the Ravian desktop app.

## How Chat Mode uses integrations

In Chat Mode, integrations are used to:

- **Pull context into the conversation** (e.g., “Summarize the latest version of the Q4 plan from Notion”).  
- **Push outcomes out of the conversation** (e.g., “Send this summary to the team as an email”).  
- **Chain small automations together** (e.g., “Draft an email, schedule a follow‑up, and log a note in Notion”).

For a complete list of all integrations and configuration details, see **Integrations → Connected Apps**.
