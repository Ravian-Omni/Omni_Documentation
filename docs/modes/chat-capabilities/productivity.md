## Example: Meeting follow-up

1. After a call, type:

    ```text title="Prompt"
    Draft follow-up emails to everyone on today's 2pm call summarizing action items.
    ```

2. Ravian reads your notes or transcript and drafts personalized emails for each attendee.

3. Review drafts inline, edit if needed, then approve → emails are sent.

4. Follow up: Add these action items to my Notion project page — done in the same thread.

Perfect for staying productive without leaving the conversation.
