# Research in Chat Mode

Ravian AI performs **conversational research** directly in your chat thread, browsing the web and synthesizing findings into structured notes or summaries.

Ask a research question and get answers with sources, not just links — all within the conversation flow.

## What this capability does

In Chat Mode, research works conversationally:

- Browse the web and extract relevant facts, quotes, and data points.
- Return structured results (bullets, tables, short reports) with source links.
- Follow up naturally: "dig deeper on X" or "compare with Y."
- Maintain context across the chat session for iterative refinement.
- Cite sources inline so you can verify claims immediately.

!!! note
    Chat Mode research stays lightweight and interactive — perfect for quick insights during conversations.

## Example: Competitor analysis

1. Ask in the chat:

    ```text title="Prompt"
    What's the current state of AI agents like Devin and compare them to traditional RPA tools?
    ```
    
2. Ravian browses relevant sources and returns a comparison table with strengths, weaknesses, and pricing.

3. Follow up: Show me recent customer reviews of Devin — Ravian continues from the same context.

4. Get a synthesized answer with quotes and links, ready to copy into emails or docs.

This pattern works for any quick research needed during your workday.
