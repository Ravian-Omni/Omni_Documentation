# Chat Mode

Chat Mode is Ravian’s **conversational workspace** for fast, everyday automation. It behaves like a chat assistant, but with real execution: sending emails, browsing the web, and working with your apps directly from a single message.

Use Chat Mode when you want speed and interactivity more than long, orchestrated workflows.

## When to use Chat Mode

Chat Mode is best for:

- Quick workflows where you want to stay in the loop.
- Tasks that fit in a single conversation: draft → review → refine.
- Exploratory work where you are still figuring out what you need.

Typical examples:

- “Summarize this PDF and draft a follow‑up email.”
- “Research three competitor tools and give me a comparison table.”
- “Clean this CSV and tell me the top five trends.”

## What Chat Mode can do

Within Chat Mode, Ravian can run most of its core capabilities:

- **Autonomous research** – browse the web, collect sources, and return structured notes or short reports.
- **Data analysis & visualization** – load files you attach, run EDA, and return charts or summaries.
- **Presentation generation** – turn a conversation, outline, or document into a slide deck.
- **Web automation & browsing** – open sites, extract data, and fill forms for one‑off tasks.
- **App & workflow integration** – interact with connected tools like email, calendar, and documents.
- **Multimodal processing** – transcribe audio or video, interpret images, and mix them into a single answer.

All of this happens in a chat thread, so you can ask follow‑up questions and refine the output naturally.

## How Chat Mode executes actions

A typical Chat Mode flow looks like this:

1. **You describe the outcome** in natural language (for example, “Draft an email to reschedule my 3pm meeting and update my calendar.”).
2. Ravian **plans a short sequence of actions** internally.
3. It **executes** those actions: browsing, reading files, drafting content, or calling connected apps.
4. It **shows you the result** in the conversation and, when needed, asks for approval before sending or changing anything high‑impact.

You keep full control through inline approvals and quick edits.

## Best practices for Chat Mode

- **Think in outcomes.** Ask for the final thing you want (email, summary, deck) rather than just “help” with a step.
- **Attach context.** Upload files, paste snippets, or reference previous messages so Ravian has everything it needs.
- **Iterate.** Use short follow‑ups like “shorten this,” “make it more formal,” or “add a risks section” to refine results.

When your request starts to involve many systems, dozens of steps, or recurring runs, switch to **Task Mode** for more structure and reliability.
