# Presentation Generation

Ravian AI creates **end‑to‑end presentations** from a single instruction, combining research, data analysis, and design into a finished deck.

You provide the topic and audience; Ravian handles structure, content, visuals, and export.

## What this capability does

With presentation generation, Ravian can:

- Research a topic or reuse existing analyses and notes.
- Propose an outline with sections, slide titles, and key talking points.
- Draft slide content, including bullets, speaker notes, and data summaries.
- Insert or suggest charts, tables, and images for key insights.
- Export to your preferred presentation format and save it in your workspace.

!!! note
    Ravian can build decks directly from structured data or previous tasks, so you avoid rebuilding slides each time the data updates.

## Typical workflows

Common presentation workflows include:

- Market landscape or competitor analysis decks.
- Quarterly business reviews based on recent metrics.
- Technical architecture overviews for engineering teams.
- Training or onboarding content generated from documentation.

You can also ask Ravian to adapt a deck for different audiences, such as executives vs. technical stakeholders.

## Example: Deck from a research brief

1. Start from a completed research task, or describe your goal, for example:

    ```text title="prompt"
    Using the research you just did on enterprise AI agents, create a 12-slide presentation for non-technical executives.
    ```
    
2. Ravian reads the existing research, drafts an outline, and generates slide content aligned to that audience.

3. It creates a deck file and saves it to your chosen folder, ready to open in your presentation tool.

4. You can ask Ravian to “tighten slide 3”, “add a risks slide”, or “simplify this deck to 6 slides” and it will update the same file.

This lets you iterate quickly without manually editing every slide.
