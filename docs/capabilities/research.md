# Autonomous Research

Ravian AI performs **end‑to‑end research** across the web, documents, and data sources, turning open‑ended questions into structured, actionable outputs.

Instead of collecting links manually, you describe the outcome you want and Ravian handles discovery, reading, synthesis, and formatting.

## What this capability does

Ravian’s autonomous research engine can:

- Discover and open relevant sources across the web, files, and knowledge bases.
- Extract key facts, statistics, arguments, and counter‑arguments, while filtering noise.
- Organize findings into outlines, briefs, reports, or slide decks tailored to your audience.
- Maintain context across long sessions so follow‑up questions refine, not restart, the research.
- Validate claims by cross‑checking multiple sources and highlighting areas of uncertainty.

!!! note
    Ravian runs on your device, so source content and intermediate notes stay local while it navigates and reads on your behalf.

## Typical workflows

Common research workflows include:

- Market and competitor landscapes for a specific region or segment.
- Technical deep dives on frameworks, architectures, or standards.
- Policy, legal, or compliance overviews synthesized from multiple documents.
- Academic‑style literature reviews with structured summaries.

For each workflow, you provide the topic, audience, and format (for example, “executive memo”, “10‑slide deck”, or “FAQ”), and Ravian aligns the research accordingly.

## Example: Market landscape report

1. Describe your goal, for example:

    ```text title="Prompt"
    Research the Indian SME lending market and create a 5-page report with key players, product types, and regulatory constraints.
    ```

2. Ravian plans steps such as scanning news, analyst reports, and regulatory sites, then extracting and clustering insights.

3. It drafts a report with sections like Market Overview, Key Players, Trends, and Risks, and saves it to your workspace.

4. You review the result and ask Ravian to add visuals or refine sections as needed.

This same pattern works for competitive tear-downs, technology evaluations, and industry overviews.
