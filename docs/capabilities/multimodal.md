# Multimedia Processing

Ravian AI supports **multimodal workflows**, combining text, images, audio, and video in a single autonomous process.

This lets you design tasks that span transcription, visual analysis, generation, and narration without switching tools.

## What this capability does

Multimodal processing allows Ravian to:

- Transcribe audio or video into searchable text.
- Analyze images or frames, extracting objects, text, or visual patterns.
- Generate images or visual assets to support documents and presentations.
- Create voice output from text, such as narrated summaries or briefings.
- Combine modalities, for example, summarize a video and then build slides from the key moments.

!!! note
    Multimodal features integrate with Ravian’s other capabilities, so outputs can feed directly into research, analysis, or presentation tasks.

## Typical workflows

Examples include:

- Transcribing interviews or meetings and generating follow‑up emails and action items.
- Analyzing screenshots or dashboards and turning them into structured reports.
- Creating narrated video explainers from existing documents or slide decks.
- Generating illustrative images for reports or marketing content.

Because everything runs as part of a single workflow, you avoid manual export/import steps between tools.

## Example: Video to deck and summary

1. Ask Ravian, for example:

    ```text title="prompt"
    Take this recorded webinar, transcribe it, extract the key insights, and create a 12-slide presentation plus a 1-page written summary.
    ```
    
2. Ravian ingests the video, generates a transcript, and identifies important sections and themes.

3. It builds a slide deck with titles, bullets, and optional visuals, then drafts a concise summary document.

4. You can optionally ask Ravian to generate a narrated version of the deck for async viewing.

This bridges raw multimedia content and polished, shareable outputs with minimal manual effort.
