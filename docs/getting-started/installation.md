# Installation

This page explains how to install Ravian AI on Windows and macOS and verify that everything is working.

Ravian is a **device‑native** application, so installation happens on your local machine rather than in the browser.

## System requirements

- Operating system: **Windows** or **macOS** with a modern 64‑bit processor.
- Stable internet connection for web‑based automations and updates.
- Sufficient disk space for logs, cached data, and generated outputs.

    Ravian runs alongside your existing tools and does not require moving your workflows to the cloud.

## First‑run setup

On first launch, Ravian may guide you through a brief setup:

- Grant permissions needed to control windows, read or write files, and automate other applications.
- Choose where Ravian should store generated documents and logs.
- Optionally connect accounts such as email or calendars so Ravian can automate communications and scheduling.

!!! note
    Ravian only uses the access it needs to complete your tasks and keeps processing on your device.

## Verify your installation

To confirm that everything is working:

1. Open Ravian and make sure the home screen loads without errors.
2. In the input box, ask: `Summarize what Ravian AI is in three bullet points.`
3. Check that Ravian responds quickly and displays the answer in the main panel.

If you see connection errors, permission issues, or repeated failures to execute tasks, visit the **FAQ** section for troubleshooting steps or contact your administrator.

Next, follow **Quick Start** to run your first autonomous workflow, or try **First Task** for a more guided example.
