# Your First Workflow

This guide walks you through a complete **end‑to‑end workflow** with Ravian AI so you can see how planning, execution, and validation work together.

You will automate a realistic task: researching a topic and turning the result into a short presentation.

---

## What you will build

By the end of this guide, Ravian will:

- Collect up‑to‑date information about a chosen topic.  
- Synthesize the findings into a concise outline.  
- Generate a slide deck you can present to stakeholders.

You only provide the goal and a few constraints; Ravian handles the rest.

---

## 1. Define the goal

1. Open Ravian and ensure you are on the main screen.  
2. In the input box, describe your goal, for example:

            ```text title="Prompt"
            Research the current state of AI agents for enterprise automation and create a 10-slide presentation for a business audience.
            Focus on India and use examples from the last 12 months.
            ```

!!! tip
    Think in terms of the final asset you want (report, deck, app), not the individual steps.

## 2. Inspect the generated plan
Ravian converts your goal into a structured plan.

Typical steps include:

- Discover and open relevant sources.

- Extract key points, statistics, and counter‑arguments.

- Organize content into sections.

- Draft the presentation structure and speaker notes.

Review the plan, make edits if necessary, then click Approve and run.

## 3. Let Ravian execute
Once approved, Ravian’s Large Action Model takes over.

During execution it may:

- Open browser windows, search, and navigate across multiple sites.

- Capture notes and intermediate summaries.

- Create or update a presentation file in your workspace.

You can watch progress, pause, or stop the task from the execution view.

!!! note
    Ravian tracks context across many steps, allowing longer workflows to complete reliably without manual babysitting.

## 4. Review and refine the output
When the workflow finishes:

1. Open the generated presentation.

2. Check that the structure, tone, and level of detail match your audience.

3. Ask Ravian to refine sections, update data, or add visuals, for example:

    ```text title="prompt"
    Add one slide with a simple chart comparing manual vs Ravian-driven automation time.
    Ravian updates the existing deck instead of starting from scratch.
    ```

## 5. Reuse the pattern
You can adapt this pattern for many scenarios:

- Market or competitor analysis decks.

- Internal training presentations.

- Data‑driven summaries created from CSVs or dashboards.

The core loop is the same: state the outcome → approve the plan → let Ravian execute → refine the result.
